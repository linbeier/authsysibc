# TODO

The scaffolding tool creates a module with countless todos. These todos are placed in places in which you much delete them and fill them with what the module you are building needs.

## APP
types: every single file authority should have several items including file hash, owner, authority:
type fileauth struct {
	Hash  string         `json:"hash"`
	Owner sdk.AccAddress `json:"owner"`
	Origin sdk.AccAddress `json:"origin"`
	Auth  string		 `json:"auth"`
}
authority set is implement by letters, 'r' for read, 'w' for write, 't' for transfer, they are combined in a certain sequnce. For example, 'rwt' represents the account have read, write and transfer authorities.


Once you have created your module and you are ready to integrate it into your app then you can follow the readme that is generated in the scaffolding of the app.

## USAGE
first
```
make install
```
make sure they are installed correctly
```
appd/appcli
```
init appd
```
appd init testnode --chain-id testchain
```
config client
```
appcli config chain-id testchain
appcli config output json
appcli config indent true
appcli config trust-node true
```
We'll use the "test" keyring backend which save keys unencrypted in the configuration directory of your project. NEVER use in production
```
appcli config keyring-backend test
```

create users
```
appcli keys add alice
appcli keys add bob
```
add both accounts and coins to genesis file
```
appd add-genesis-account $(appcli keys show alice -a) 100000token,1000000000stake
appd add-genesis-account $(appcli keys show bob -a) 100000token,1000000000stake
```

The "nscli config" command saves configuration for the "nscli" command but not for "nsd" so we have to declare the keyring-backend with a flag here
```
appd gentx --name alice --keyring-backend test
```
After you have generated a genesis transaction, you will have to input the genTx into the genesis file, so that your nameservice chain is aware of the validators. 
```
appd collect-gentxs
```
make sure your genesis file is correct
```
appd validate-genesis
```

start your chain
```
appd start
```

 First, check whether accounts have correct funds
 ```
appcli query account $(appcli keys show alice -a)
appcli query account $(appcli keys show bob -a)
```

declare your file authority first
```
appcli tx fileauthservice setfile [filename] [filehash] [authority] --from [account]
```
