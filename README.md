# authsysibc

This is a ibc version(support for inter-blockchain communication)authsys system

## Why?
1. By transparenting dataflow, data transferring can be trusted. For example, for very private information like telephone number/ ID number, we can store these information in 
a database that is totally seperate from Internet. The only way to fetch information is from this authsys system. By fetching information, firstly the system will check
if you have the authority to do that. For instance, court or goverment or someone have pass token given by owner can fetch your info. However, other entities that don't have
the authority can not view information.
2. Fetch data from this system will inevitably leave their trace. The system will record any dataflowing by constraining only one smart contrast to fetch data. And this contrast
includes record action.(constract can only be done all or not done)
3. You can trace your data at any time. As long as your data still in this system(or other same system connected to this system), you can trace your data by sending a trace request
(may cost tokens).

## Future?
This is an ideal system, more entities that are covered by this system, more powerful this system will be.
But there is almost no way to spread this system.
Because of following drawbacks: 
1. unefficiency, may be solved by changing consensus algorithm 
2. not that ugent to apply extreme method like this system, building systems like this system will cost a lot, not economic to do that.

## Improve?
